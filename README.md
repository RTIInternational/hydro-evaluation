# Hydro-Evaluation

This `hydro-evaluation` repo is the original repo used for research code
related to the CIROH Integrated Evaluation System project.  The main library 
code development was moved to https://github.com/RTIInternational/teehr/.
This repo is being kept active as a playground for trying out new ideas.
