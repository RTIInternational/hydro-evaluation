# Proposed Data Stack

* Python - Main programming language
* Hasura - Web API and Database Migrations (GraphQL)
    * Alternates - SQAlchemy, Flyway
* FastAPI - for custom endpoints (e.g., metrics calculations)
* Postgres, TimescaleDB, PostGIS - Data storage
* React of Vue - Frontend web UI
* Prefect - manage workflows
* Docker/Docker Compose
* Python, pandas, xarray from processing

Lean towards a stack that can be run locally as well as in the cloud.
