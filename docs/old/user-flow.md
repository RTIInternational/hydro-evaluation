# ISED Story Flow
The ISED use case has the HES running as a service.  As such there are at least two users in this use case; the HES admin who is responsible for creating the HES instance and the ISED user who is responsible of using the HES once it is running.

The research user may be responsible for both standing up the system as well as loading data, running the evaluation and running the verification report.
